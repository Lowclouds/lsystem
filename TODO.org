* Splines for paths
  Maybe rework end path, }, to take parameter specifying 
  what to do with path, i.e. create path or create contour, 
  since overlapping paths seems unlikely to be of use
** Hermite
<2022-06-11 Sat> open Hermite spline done, including setting radii with spline
  still need to implement segments/pair of control point - currently #segments
  applies to entire spline
** B-spline
  on back burner
* Surfaces/meshes
Two different TABOP notions, pre-defined by arrays, and L-system generated, 
in addition to loading pref-defined BABYLON meshes. The first is relatively
easy, the last really appealing from a usability pov
** Pre-defined Arrays
** L-system generated
Extrusions go a long way toward this already, maybe enhance this or look at ribbons.
Alternatively, directly create meshes from turtle positions
Not sure about cpfg bspline design
** Supported Babylonjs types, glb, gltf, ..
** Export meshes
<2022-06-20 Mon> gltf export done
* Homomorphism productions
Nice to have
* Decomposition productions* UI
** <2022-06-20 Mon> show color table and save mesh implemented
** To React or not to React????

#+TITLE: L-System Modules Quick Guide

#+BEGIN_VERSE
Why are they called modules and not commands or something else?
Because module is an old term used by botanists for a unit of
growth (article in French from the Latin for branch and
translated to module in English.)

Modules marked *u* are *unimplemented*
Modules marked *p* are *partially implemented*

* Turtle Motion
|F(d) | move d units w/pen down, records track point
|f(d) | move d units w/pen up, records track point
|G(d) | ==== F(d), but does not record track points
|g(d) | ==== f(d), w/o recording track points
|@M(x,y,z) | goto position, draw or not|

* Turtle Orientation
| +(a)                    | yaw left a degrees                       |
| &(a)                    | pitch down a degrees                     |
| ^(a)                    | pitch up a degrees                       |
| \(a)                    | roll left a degrees                      |
| /(a)                    | roll right a degrees                     |
| \vert                   | yaw 180 degrees |
| @v                      | roll so U is parallel to up [y]          |
| @R(hx,hy,hz[,ux,uy,uz]) | set heading to [hx,hy,hz]                |
|                         | set U parallel to [ux,uy,z], if supplied |

* Turtle Settings
|;(i)   |increase or set color/material index|
|,(i)   |decrease or set color/material index|
|@;(n)  |increase or set back face color/material index|
|@,(n)  |decrease or set back face color/material index|
|#(n)   |increase or set line width|
|!(n)   |decrease or set line width|
|@Tx(n) *u* |set texture index|
|@D(s) *u* |set scale factor of subsequent geometry|
|@Di(f) *u* |multiply scale factor by f|

* Turtle Geometry
| @o(d)    | circle of diameter d                              |
| @C(d)*u* | circle of diameter d in HL plane                  |
| @O(d)    | sphere of diameter d                              |
| ~S *u*   | insert predefined surface, Sym                    |
| @Ds(id)  | start a contour with tag id                       |
| @De(id)  | end contour id                                    |
| @#(id)   | set contour(id) as current track shape            |
| {        | start polygon                                     |
| }        | end polygon                                       |
| {(0)     | start path with stepwise control pts              |
| {(1)     | start open path with Hermite spline control pts   |
| {(2)     | start closed path with Hermite spline control pts |
| {(3)     | start open path with B-spline control pts         |
| {(4)     | start closed path with B-spline control pts       |
| }(i)     | end path with type i and extrude contour          |
| .        | add current position to path, polygon, or contour |

* L-system Geometry
| [               | start branch, pushing state onto stack    |
| ]               | end branch, popping branch state stack    |
| % *u*           | cut modules to end of branch              |
| ?(id,scale) *p* | push current L-system and use L-system id |
| $               | end current L-system, return to previous  |
